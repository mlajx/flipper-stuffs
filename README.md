# My Flipper Zero Scripts

This is my public repo for my flipper zero scripts. Here I keep all my scripts encrypted that I download during the powershell executation.

The only way (that I think) it's possible to revert to the original data is by having the key that I used during the encryption. The key is available only in the private repo and on my flipper.

Everything here still WIP.
